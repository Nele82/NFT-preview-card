### What I learned

I have to say that I am doubly pleased as i've refreshed on many aspects on CSS amongst which "position" in combination with "z-index" properties which i feel that only looks easy at first.

### Continued development

When it comes to design, there are many guidelines to follow in terms of layout & size which I intent to fortify. Currently my primary focus is on Java Script and even though it wasn't a main theme of this project, there were a lot of instances that I could've solved in quarter of the time by using JS.

## Acknowledgments

Even though this is my very first public project carried out without any kind of direct tutoring, i have to praise a developer from the above mentioned YouTube video [resource](#useful-resources). I  would go as far as saying that it made this project possible seeing how i did not have prior knowledge in using Git in conjunction with GitHub.
